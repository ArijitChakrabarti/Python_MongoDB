**MongoDB** is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables. MongoDB is a database which came into light around the mid-2000s.

I have created this .ipynb file to help use MongoDB.  Both from the perspective of accessing a database as well as uploading a file to a MongoDB.  I have included all the necessary files here.
